When we started the light music club we said that our slogan was going to be “Budokan or bust!” We worked after school jobs together so I could buy Geeta. We had tea in the club room together and talked about everything. We had training camps at Mugi-chan’s summer homes and looked for a new student who would join the club. I can’t really say we devoted our selves wholeheartedly to practicing, but right now, for us standing here on this stage this auditorium is our Budokan, and we’ll sing our hearts out to the very end! / Yui Hirasawa
